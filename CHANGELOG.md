# CHANGELOG

## In development

### feature/custom-tools

* Rewrite of slide tools integration in admin interface. Now the tools are
  directives that can be injected in the administration.
* Cleanup of `web/` folder. Now all files have been moved to bundles in `src/`.
  The files are now installed from the bundles' `Resources/public/` folder.
  This results in a need to go through all templates paths and make sure they
  reflect the new structure. The template scanner will go through all files in
  `web/bundles/` and look for public/templates/ folders.

* Made "Continue" button sticky for slide and channel creation.
