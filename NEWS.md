# OS2display News

## 20. May 2019

* Released admin 6.1.0: https://github.com/os2display/admin/releases/tag/6.1.0

This release adds screen-bundle to os2display (see https://github.com/os2display/screen-bundle). This introduces the [admin_path]/screen route that is an alternative to using screen: https://github.com/os2display/screen. This furthermore, adds preview of channels and screens inside the administration.

NB! To make this bundle work additional nginx settings are required, that will expose the middleware to the admin installation. See https://github.com/os2display/vagrant/commit/2b5f35269f3b1a18ba245e8e894253c4faa743b3#diff-8d60e524ea68140466b5d4631fba2f01 for the required nginx config.
